SwerveTest1 - DEV/Design notes 2022-02-16

Assumptions:
=============================
1. RoboRIO and VSCode are all up to date ith latest libraries and firmware.
2. Chassis is built with SwerveDrive assemblies installed and wired to CAN Bus, RoboRIO, and PDP.
3. SparkMax controllers (4) are connected to the PDP and CAN Bus.
4. NEO Rev-21-1850 motors are connected to SparkMax controllers (black, red, white connectors)

Constraints:
=============================
1. SparkMax controllers must be connected via USB-C cable for settings/configuration using REV Hardware Client.
2. 12V electrical system
3. Max load is 30 amps

Given:
=============================
SwerveDrive assemblies (AndyMark Swerve & Steer) use SparkMax Controllers and NEO Rev-21-1650 brushless motors.
There are 4 assemblies.  Installed on each corner of the chassis.
There are 2 motors per assembly
    Drive Motor is NEO Rev-21-1650 for drive.  Encoder is the Hall-Effect encoder.
    PG Steer motor connected to TalonSRX controller.  Lamprey Encoder connected to TalonSRX. ???
There are 2 controllers per assembly.
    REV SparkMax connected to Neo motor.
	Phoenix TalonSRX controller connected to PG am-3009_NPPA motor.
SwerveDrive assembly distance from center of Robot is 0.175 meters.
NEO drive motor has encoder built-in.
PG am-3009_NPPA steer motor 


Tasks
Hardware Device Configuration
=============================
1. Planning. Map CAN devices and update configuration.   Electrical Plan, Systems Diagram, etc.

   Draw a picture.  (on paper or whiteboard initially)
   Model it in a drawing tool (like Draw.io)
   
   See SwerveDrive-model.drawio

2. Get CAN device IDs using "REV Hardware Client" software for Drive Motors.
   For each SparkMax controller connected to NEO Rev-21-1650.

3. Get CAN device IDs using "Phoenix Tuner" software for Steer Motors.
   For each TalonSRX controller connected to PG Steer Motor am-3009_NPLU
   Lamprey Encoder connected to TalonSRX.

4. Get CAN device IDs using "Phoenix Tuner" software for "Climber-in-a-Box" motors.

5. Calibrate Lamprey Encoder (on the Swerve & Steer assembly).  Per https://www.andymark.com/products/lamprey-absolute-encoder  
   


Programming Tasks
=============================
1. Update Constants.java with CAN IDs for each SparkMax controller.
     /**
     * IDs for Spark Max Controllers on the bot 
     */
    public static final int LEFT_FRONT_SPARK_MAX_ID = 4;
    //public static final int LEFT_BACK_SPARK_MAX_ID = 2;
    //public static final int RIGHT_FRONT_SPARK_MAX_ID = 3;
    //public static final int RIGHT_BACK_SPARK_MAX_ID = 1;

    ... etc.  Add more here... IDs of XboxController, Speed Modifiers, etc.
	
2. Update Robot.java teleOpPeriodic() method to add call to get DriveTrainCommand instance from RobotContainer instance.
 /** This function is called periodically during operator control. */
  @Override
  public void teleopPeriodic() {
    //System.out.println("ping");
    m_robotContainer.getDriveTrainCommand().execute();
  }

3. Update RobotContainer.java to declare DriveTrainSubsyste and DriveTrainCommand objects.

  // Connects DrivetrainSubsystem and DriveTrainCommand together
  private final DriveTrainSubsystem m_driveTrainSubsystem = new DriveTrainSubsystem();
  private final DriveTrainCommand m_driveTrainCommand = new DriveTrainCommand(m_driveTrainSubsystem);

4. Update RobotContainer.java to add public getter returning the DriveTrainCommand object.

  /**
   * Returns the DriveTrainCommand object to run drive train during teleop
   */
  public Command getDriveTrainCommand() {
    // System.out.println("DRIVE TRAIN");
    return m_driveTrainCommand;
  }
  
 4. Update DriveTrainSubsystem class
 
 ...
 
 5. Update DriveTrainCommand class
